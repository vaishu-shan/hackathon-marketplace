        TickETH is a blockchain-based platform that tokenizes event tickets as
        NFTs, transforming them into secure, verifiable digital assets that can
        be traded and validated on the Lisk blockchain. This project directly
        aligns with the Real-World Assets (RWA) track by bridging the gap
        between physical event access and digital ownership, leveraging the
        unique capabilities of blockchain technology to enhance security,
        transparency, and efficiency in the event ticketing industry.

            TickETH turns physical event tickets into digital assets (NFTs) on
            the Lisk blockchain. These NFTs represent ownership of a real-world
            asset—the right to attend an event—ensuring that each ticket is
            unique, verifiable, and tamper-proof.

            By leveraging Lisk's blockchain technology, TickETH addresses common
            issues in traditional ticketing, such as counterfeiting and
            scalping. The immutability of the blockchain guarantees that each
            ticket's ownership history and authenticity can be easily verified,
            providing a secure and transparent solution for both event
            organisers and attendees.

            The platform integrates real-time validation mechanisms, allowing
            event organisers to verify ticket ownership at the point of entry.
            This process, facilitated by Lisk's fast and efficient blockchain
            infrastructure, ensures that only legitimate ticket holders gain
            access to events, enhancing security and user experience.
